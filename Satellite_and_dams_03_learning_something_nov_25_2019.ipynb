        "Tailings dams are massive structures designed to contain the waste slurry remaining after processing ore at open pit and underground mines. These structures fail far more regularly than normal water-storage dams. In recent years, catastrophic tailings dam failures have occurred, causing significant damage to the environment and even loss of life. To mitigate these catastrophic events in the future, there is an urgent need to develop cost-effective methods to monitor the structural stability of these constructions over time. The lack of current cost-effective monitoring methods prompted us to investigate whether ambient seismic noise can be used to detect internal changes in a tailings dam wall during a period of heavy rainfall. We recorded three weeks of..."

        "Vegetation indices play an important role in monitoring variations in vegetation. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) proposed by the MODIS Land Discipline Group and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are both global-based vegetation indices aimed at providing consistent spatial and temporal information regarding global vegetation. However, many environmental factors such as atmospheric conditions and soil background may produce errors in these indices. The topographic effect is another very important factor, especially when the indices are used in areas of rough terrain. In this paper, we theoretically analyzed differences in the topographic effect on the EVI and the NDV"
